Hi, I'm Kajsa! 

I received my PhD in Economics from <a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/kajsa-ganhammar" class="custom-link">Lund University</a> in June 2025. During my PhD studies I was also affiliated to the <a href="https://www.ifn.se/nyheter/2025/2025-06-03-kajsa-ganhammar-nydisputerad/" class="custom-link">Research Institute of Industrial Economics</a>. My main research interests lie at the intersection of energy economics and market design, with a particular interest in the design and performance of electricity markets in presence of renewable energies.
