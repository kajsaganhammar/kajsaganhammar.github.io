I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at <a href='https://portal.research.lu.se/sv/persons/kajsa-ganhammar' target='_blank'>Lund University</a>. I am also affiliated to <a href='https://www.ifn.se/forskare/doktorander/kajsa-ganhammar/' target='_blank'>the Reserach Institute of Industrial Economics</a>. In my ongoing research, I employ both empirical methods and theoretical modelling to analyse how green el-certificates affects investment and strategic bidding in electrcicty markets, as well as the role of serach frictions in auction markets.  

I have a master's degree in Economics from Lund University and double bachelor's degrees in Political Sciences and Environmental Sciences, both with majors in Economics, partly from Gothenburg University and partly from Lund University.
