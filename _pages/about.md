I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at <a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/kajsa-ganhammar" class="custom-link">Lund University</a>. I am also affiliated to the <a href="https://www.ifn.se/en/researchers/graduate-students/kajsa-ganhammar/" class="custom-link">Research Institute of Industrial Economics</a>. My main research interests lie at the intersection of energy economics and market design, with a particular interest in the design and performance of electricity markets in presence of renewable energies. In my ongoing research, I use theoretical modelling to analyse bidding behaviour in the electricity market when incorporating the effect of a co-existing market for green certificates, as well as the role of search frictions in competing auction markets.  

I have a master's degree in Economics and dual bachelor's degrees in Environmental Sciences and Political Sciences, with majors in Economics.

I am on the job market in 2024/2025.
