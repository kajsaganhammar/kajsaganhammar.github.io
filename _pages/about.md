## About me
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at <a href='https://portal.research.lu.se/sv/persons/kajsa-ganhammar' target='_blank'>Lund University</a>. I am also affiliated to the <a href='https://www.ifn.se/forskare/doktorander/kajsa-ganhammar/' target='_blank'>Research Institute of Industrial Economics</a>. In my ongoing research, I employ both empirical methods and theoretical modelling to analyse how green electricity certificates affects investment and strategic bidding in electricity markets, as well as the role of search frictions in auction markets.  

I have a master's degree in Economics from Lund University and double bachelor's degrees in Political Sciences and Environmental Sciences, both with majors in Economics, partly from Gothenburg University and partly from Lund University.
