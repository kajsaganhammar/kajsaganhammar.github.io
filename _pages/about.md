### About me
I am a fifth-year PhD Candidate in Economics at <a href='https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/kajsa-ganhammar' target='_blank'>Lund University</a>. I am also affiliated to the <a href='https://www.ifn.se/en/researchers/graduate-students/kajsa-ganhammar/' target='_blank'>Research Institute of Industrial Economics</a>. My main research interests lie at the intersection of energy economics and market design. In my ongoing research, I use theoretical modelling to analyse bidding behaviour in the electricity market when incorporating the effect of a co-existing market for green certificates, as well as the role of search frictions in auction markets.  

I have a master's degree in Economics and dual bachelor's degrees in Environmental Sciences and Political Sciences, both with majors in Economics.
